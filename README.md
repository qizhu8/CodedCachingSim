# CodedCaching

This repository shows part of the work for the publication
Yu Wang, and Alhussein A. Abouzeid, "On the Privacy Leakage of Coded Caching." 2020 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC): Communication
and Information Systems Security Symposium (IEEE ICC'20 - CISS Symposium) 

I implement the general idea of the Coded Caching scheme in 
Maddah-Ali, Mohammad Ali, and Urs Niesen. "Fundamental limits of caching." IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 60.5 (2014): 2856-2867.



Currently, my program is in charge of generating a so-called X-D table which indicates the relationship between user demands and the server transmission. 

The required packages are shown in *requirements.txt*

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In folder *./CodedCaching*, `Network.py` is the file you would like to run first.

```
cd CodedCaching
python3 Network.py
```
