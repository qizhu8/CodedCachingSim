# CodedCaching

I implement the general idea of the Coded Caching scheme in 
Maddah-Ali, Mohammad Ali, and Urs Niesen. "Fundamental limits of caching." IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 60.5 (2014): 2856-2867.

Currently, my program is in charge of generating a so-called X-D table which indicates the relationship between user demands and the server transmission. 

The required packages are shown in *requirements.txt*

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In folder *./CodedCaching*, `Network.py` is the file you would like to run first.

```
cd CodedCaching
python3 Network.py
```
